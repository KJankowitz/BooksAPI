# BooksAPI
Project to log and rate books as well as notes using Node.js with Express.js with API functionality and PostgreSQL database.
Frontend is built with Bootstrap.

PostgreSQL will need to be pre-installed and a "books" database must be created with your own password. Adjust index.js accordingly :) 

To run app:
1) Clone repo using repo url and command "git clone <url>"
2) Open in VS code and install npm packages using command "npm i"
3) In terminal, run "node index.js"
4) On browser, open url "localhost:3000"
5) Enjoy!

I am aware of slightly limited functionality and will aim to update the project in the future with features such as adding and deleting notes,
as well as providing user-relevant errors to the frontendüëç
